 props :vs state :
    props (short for “properties”) and state are both plain JavaScript objects.
    While both hold information that influences the output of render,
    they are different in one important way: props get passed to the component
    (similar to function parameters) whereas state is managed within the component
    (similar to variables declared within a function).

 Fragments : A common pattern in React is for a component to return multiple elements.
 Fragments let you group a list of children without adding extra nodes to the DOM.

PropTypes : You can define components without PropTypes.
 But, without PropTypes or some form of type checking, we run into the risk of
  passing in a wrong data type to a component, which could cause a crash or
  some unexpected behavior in your application.
